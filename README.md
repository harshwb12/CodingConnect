Project Description:

I developed this dynamic and user-friendly website called CodingConnect, which serves as an effective interface between mentors and students in a coding club. The website streamlines the management of coding groups, problem sets, announcements, and group administration, making it easier for mentors to engage with their students and provide valuable resources for learning.

Key Features:

Group Management: Mentors have the ability to create and manage their coding groups.

Problem Sets and Resources: Mentors can share coding problems and related resources with their respective groups. These problem sets serve as a valuable tool for students to practice and enhance their coding skills.

Announcements: Mentors can make important announcements and updates for their coding groups. This feature ensures effective communication between mentors and students, keeping them informed about upcoming events, contests, and any other relevant information.

Group Admin: The website includes administrative features specifically designed for mentors. They can manage and modify group details, including assigning roles, and monitoring the progress of students.

Notes and Favorites: Users, which include both mentors and students, can add personal notes to coding problems for future reference. They can also mark specific problems as favorites.

Contest Details: The website provides a comprehensive view of upcoming coding contests of Codechef , Codeforces , Atcoder , including details such as date, time, and contest rules. This feature ensures that users stay informed about important coding events and can participate accordingly.

Tech Stack:
The website was developed using the following technologies:

Node.js | Express.js | EJS | Mongoose | MongoDb | CSS | Bootstrap | HTML

Future Plans - 
1) Move the whole frontend to React .
